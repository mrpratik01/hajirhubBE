## Legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ | Built, wired, tested |
| 🔧 | Stub exists / partially built |
| ⏳ | Planned, not started |
| ❌ | Explicitly deferred |

---

## Section A — Authentication

> Auth is handled entirely by Supabase client SDK (React Native / Web).  
> Backend only verifies the JWT — no login/signup endpoints needed.

| What | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| JWT verification middleware (`requireSupabaseUser`) | ✅ | `src/middleware/auth.js` |
| Role guard — owner/super_admin (`requireOwnerRole`) | ✅ | `src/middleware/requireOwnerRole.js` |
| Role guard — owner/hr/super_admin (`requireStaffRole`) | ✅ | `src/middleware/requireStaffRole.js` |
| Role guard — admin/super_admin (`requireAdminPlanRole`) | ✅ | `src/middleware/requireAdminRole.js` |

## Section B — Users

| Method | Route | Role | Status |
|--------|-------|------|--------|
| GET | `/api/users/me` | Any | ✅ |
| PUT | `/api/users/me` | Any | ✅ |
| GET | `/api/users` | owner, hr_manager, super_admin | ✅ |

**Files:** `src/routes/users.routes.js` · `src/controllers/users.controller.js` · `src/services/users.service.js`

---

## Section C — Organizations

| Method | Route | Role | Status |
|--------|-------|------|--------|
| POST | `/api/organizations` | Any (becomes owner) | ✅ |
| GET | `/api/organizations/me` | owner, hr_manager | ✅ |
| PUT | `/api/organizations/me` | owner | ✅ |

**Files:** `src/routes/organizations.routes.js` · `src/controllers/organizations.controller.js` · `src/services/organizations.service.js`

**Side effects on create:**
- ✅ Auto-subscribes to `pro` plan (`status = active`)
- ✅ Links creator user to org (`users.org_id`)
- ⏳ Seed default department "General"
- ⏳ Seed default shift "Day Shift" 09:00–17:00

---

## Section D — Departments

| Method | Route | Role | Status |
|--------|-------|------|--------|
| GET | `/api/departments` | owner, hr_manager | ✅ |
| POST | `/api/departments` | owner | ✅ |

| DELETE | `/api/departments/:id` | owner | ✅ |

**Files:** `src/routes/departments.routes.js` · `src/controllers/departments.controller.js` · `src/services/departments.service.js`

**Notes:**
- ✅ `sort_order` auto-assigned (MAX + 1 per org) — FE never sends it
- ✅ Resequences on delete (no gaps)
- ✅ Org-scoped — cross-tenant writes impossible

---

## Section E — Shifts

| Method | Route | Role | Status |
|--------|-------|------|--------|
| GET | `/api/shifts` | owner, hr_manager | ✅ |

## ⏳ Section K — Attendance (Next to Build)

> Most complex section. React Native handles GPS + selfie capture. Backend validates and stores.

| Method | Route | Role | Status |
|--------|-------|------|--------|
| POST | `/api/attendance/checkin` | employee | ⏳ |
| POST | `/api/attendance/checkout` | employee | ⏳ |

## Section Q — Employee Auth Provisioning ✅

All tasks complete. New files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/services/auth.service.js` | `getMe`, `changePassword` |
| `src/controllers/auth.controller.js` | Auth endpoint handlers |
| `src/routes/auth.routes.js` | `GET /api/auth/me`, `PUT /api/auth/change-password` |
| `src/middleware/checkSuspension.js` | Blocks suspended employees |
| `migrations/001_employee_auth_provisioning.sql` | DB migration to run in Supabase |

New endpoints:

| Method | Route | Role | Description |
|--------|-------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/auth/me` | employee | Profile + `password_changed`, activates on first login |
| PUT | `/api/auth/change-password` | employee | Change temp password |
| POST | `/api/employees/:id/provision-auth` | owner | Back-fill auth for existing employee |
| GET | `/api/employees/:id/credentials` | owner, hr_manager | Retrieve stored email + active status |

### ⚠️ Back-fill existing employees (one-time)

Any employee created before this feature has no auth account (`user_id = null`).
Run this SQL to find them, then call the provision endpoint for each:

```sql
-- Find employees without auth accounts
SELECT id, full_name, email, phone, org_id
FROM public.employees
WHERE user_id IS NULL
  AND status = 'active'
ORDER BY created_at;
```

Then for each employee, call:
```
POST /api/employees/:id/provision-auth
Authorization: Bearer <owner_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "email": "employee@example.com" }
```

This creates their auth account and stores credentials in `employee_credentials`.

### ⚠️ Run migration in Supabase SQL Editor

```sql
-- Copy contents of migrations/001_employee_auth_provisioning.sql
-- and run in Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
```
